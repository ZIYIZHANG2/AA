                is added to the tree by setting Parent[i] to j.
                Eventually all nodes except 1 have a (non-Null) Parent,

            this is achieved by setting the cost of node 1 to 0 (to get
            from node 1 to itself costs nothing).  Other nodes are

                More precisely, for every node k inside the current 
                tree, and every node j outside of it, the weight of
                (k,i) is smaller than (or possibly equal to) the weight
                of (k,j) for all outside nodes j. So i is picked as 
                the next node to add to the tree. The array Parent keeps
                track of the connections: Parent[i] is the spanning tree
                node that i is connected to. Note that, unless i = 1, 
                Parent[i] has already been determined.
